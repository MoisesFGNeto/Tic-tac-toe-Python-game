## Tic-toc-toe 

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-tac-toe game in Python. I created this game to practice and learn Python.

### Features
- Two Players: Two players can play the game, taking turns on the same computer.
- Interactive Board: The game displays the current state of the board after each move, allowing players to see the progress of the game.
- Player Input: Players can input their moves by selecting positions on the board.

### How to play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the game files are located.
3. Run the app.py file using Python
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game:

    - Enter the position (1-9) where you want to place your symbol ('X' or 'O').
    - The game will display the updated board after each move.
    - Continue taking turns until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
